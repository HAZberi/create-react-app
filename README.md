# Search Gallery

## Search over 30 high quality open source assets from Unsplash and Pexels with a blaze.

### Project Details

Finding quality images is a pain for small projects, design prototypes or student assignments. The idea behind Search Gallery is to pull in data from a variety of external sources for royalty free high quality images. Search Gallery gather royalty free images by accessing Unsplash and Pexels Open Source APIs. The images are then bundled together and presented in a masonry style responsive grid. The appâ€™s logic is written with React classes and the code is split between UI components.

### Possible Improvements 

* Extend Search Gallery to include royalty free videos, animations and vectors.
* Update UI to handle requests and results for videos, animations and vectors.
* Provide more options to download data efficiently.
* Implement a better searching algorithm to transform accessible data.
